<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">With a key characteristic of Magic Realism is its alterations to the various aspects of physical reality, it seems only appropriate to organise my points according to said aspects – time, space, perception and identity. Peculiar narrative events will be considered as well.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>TIME / SPACE</h3>
</div>
<img width="35%" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2d56dc_51b820833ffc47c2981a1f60bea50033~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_750,h_423,al_c,lg_1/2d56dc_51b820833ffc47c2981a1f60bea50033~mv2.png">

<p class="sideleft"><b>"TIME IN THIS CASE, HAS BECOME SPATIAL, WHERE HOURS PASS IN A FEW STEPS UP THE STAIRS"</b></p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">The passing of time is subtle and fleeting, even to the point of being incoherent. At around 25 minutes into the film, the character Laura reminds Riggan that the first preview of the Broadway play is tomorrow. However, as can be seen in Figure 1A, behind her the blue lights are already on, which indicates that the preview was already happening. This simultaneous occurrence of two events that are supposedly happening at different times makes time fleeting and almost incoherent. Time in this case, has become spatial, where hours pass in a few steps up the stairs. This hyper-rapid passing of time suggests time before the preview was insignificant. Yes, it may surely be because the narrative had nothing important happening in that time, and hence the time was simply insignificant. However, the very fact that these insignificant hours passed in a few steps showed the rejection of the mundane intricacies of life offstage, signifying the obsession Riggan and the cast have with their Broadway play. To render time spatial dimensions too brings about a new and unfamiliar experience with time, giving the impression of an obscure relationship between time and experience. This leaves the audiences slightly disorientated when watching the film and hence grow more reliant on the rules of magical aspect in the narrative. This distances the audience from the physical laws of reality and hence puts the audiences in a better position to understand the magical element of the narrative.</p>

<p class="capt">(Fig 1B. Sam and Mike staring into each other's eyes)</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">10 minutes into the 1 hour mark, the camera shows Mike and Sam making out but as it pans down, it reveals the preview is currently airing and Mike was on the stage acting. This too shows the new spatial characteristic of time as introduced earlier in the film in the example mentioned earlier. In both cases, time was given a specific and designated space – the stage. This suggests that the stage and the success of their careers are the nexus in which their conscious mind is fixated upon. This increases the subjectivity of their experience and perception, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>PERCEPTION</h3>
</div>
<p class="sideright"><b>"TIME LAPSES WHEN RIGGAN SLEEPS, HIGHLIGHTING HIS REFUSAL TO BE UNCONSCIOUS, THE OBSESSION TO BE ALWAYS AWAKE AND ALWAYS BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">The very medium we rely on to watch and thus appreciate the film is the camera itself. In the film, it has gathered a reputation for having the entire film done in a single shot (or at least appear to). This was a unique cinematic technique that although Iñárritu was not the first to conceptualise the technique, it was one of the few films which had such an approach. This extreme long take is firstly, omniscient. It does not follow only a single character (although it shadowed Riggan most of the time) and was able to observe the various events and conflicts between characters Riggan would not be aware of. It followed Mike and Sam to the rooftop and listened in on the conversation; Brandon frantically running up the stairs to settle the legal issues; Laura and Lesley backstage complaining about Mike’s brazen antics, and so on and so forth. This pushes the boundaries of the conventional singular point of view. This distributes attention to all the characters and hence reduces attachment to any of the characters (this will be elaborated further later in the discussion). Moreover, this omniscient medium is as the name suggests, defiant against the limits of the conscious mind. It records an unbroken relay of information which is often interrupted by the blinks of an eye or sleep. In the film, we are often given time lapses when Riggan sleeps, highlighting this refusal to be unconscious, the obsession to be conscious and always be awake and always be able to experience.</p>

<h3>PSYCHOKINESIS</h3>
</div>
<img width="35%" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2d56dc_375919c515f74acd84938aa00324639c~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_630,h_337,al_c,lg_1/2d56dc_375919c515f74acd84938aa00324639c~mv2.png">
<p class="capt">(Fig 2. Riggan demonstrating his psychic power)</p>
<br>
<p class="sideleft" style="margin-top:0.5%;"><b>"PSYCHOKINESIS IS
...AN EXTENSION AND PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF ONE'S WILL"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">Throughout the film, Riggan demonstrates his ability to control inanimate objects from a distance, such as a pot of flowers, a Birdman poster, or a radio. This psychokinetic power of Riggan’s is in other words, an extension and physical manifestation of one’s will. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for Riggan’s desperation and over-reaching ambition to become a legendary actor despite being a washed-up superhero actor.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>THE PERCULIAR</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">In the film, there are various individual events which seem to have no connection to one another, and they are nothing but strange. These narrative events include the jazz drum beat echoing throughout the film, the street performer, among many others.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>THE PERCULIAR: JAZZ BEAT</h3>
</div>
<img width="35%" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2d56dc_1a2c7a5bedf140ca9374961459fb7ec0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_421,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/2d56dc_1a2c7a5bedf140ca9374961459fb7ec0~mv2.webp">
<p class="capt">(Fig 3. Antonio Sanchez, composer, on the drums)</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">There is a jazz beat repeating throughout the entire movie at numerous intervals. However, this lies outside the boundaries of this discussion. What is relevant, instead, is the presence of the jazz drummer. Around 35 minutes into the film, Mike and Riggan leave the theatre to grab a drink in the nearby bar. The camera then pans towards a jazz drummer. When Riggan walks back alone, the jazz drummer is gone. We know the jazz drummer is a fragment of the magical reality because at the end of the film, when Riggan walks past the kitchen, he finds the jazz drummer drumming away. This is a highly peculiar event which can be interpreted as a metaphor for Riggan’s excitement and nervousness when his play is concerned, because he is determined to make it a success.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>THE PERCULIAR: STREET DRUNK</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">As Riggan walks out of the bar after confronting the critic Tabitha Dickinson, she hears a street performer reciting a poem from Shakespeare’s Macbeth.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody1"><i>“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time; and all of our yesterdays have lighted fools on the way to dusty death. Out, out like a brief candle. Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”.</i></p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">It is the last two sentences which ring especially relevant to Riggan’s plight. Riggan is afraid of his transition to Broadway becoming a futile resistance towards the Hollywood culture of superhero films. He is afraid of not being welcomed by the audiences. He is afraid of failure. This presence of the street performer hence serves as a metaphor for Riggan’s attitude towards failure and how he is terrified of having to associate that with himself. We then know this man is not real for he repeats the words of Ralph before he was hit on the head by a falling lamp. This was a figment of the magical reality.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>SUMMATION</h3>
</div>
<p class="sideright"><b>"THE CAMERA ITSELF WOULD THEN BE PART OF HIS MAGICAL REALITY, EXPOSING HIS NARCISSISM AND HIS DESIRE FOR ATTENTION"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">It is obvious that the magic reality in the film is a metaphor for Riggan’s psyche. This visual representation adds on to the basic plane of reality audiences are familiar with, allowing desires and fears to manifest in the form of various people. In fact, it is the Peculiar events which allow the magical to “emerge” from the real. It is subtle, yet when its presence acknowledged, can bring revelations about Riggan’s psyche. Riggan is obsessed with success, full of excitement and nervousness when he discusses about his play or acts in it, so much so that everything else is insignificant to him. Time seems so fleeting, with days passing just by climbing a flight of stairs or simply looking to the stage. This obsession has him refuse to sleep, refuse to be unconscious, for being unconscious would leave him helpless and inactive.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">This could be why the camera even exists in the first place. The film is Riggan imagining what it would be like if someone was always watching him, watching his every move. The camera itself would then be a part of this magical reality, exposing his narcissism and his desire for attention. His ambition to reach higher no matter his circumstance is so strong and palpitating that it manifests as a psychokinetic superpower. In fact, this is why his alter-ego Birdman takes form in the first place- a superhero. Riggan wants to be adored by the audience and his fans so much so he wants to be elevated both figuratively and literally. He despises yet afterwards embraces his alter-ego, flying over the streets and gloriously into the sun. He shuns yet thereafter embraces the magical reality because he realises that the magical reality is his desires and fears taking physical form. This is not subversion or suspension as the magical reality is undeniably a part of his reality in his pursuit for stardom.</p>
<br>
<p class="sideleft"><b>"THE MAGICAL REALITY ADDS ON TO THE NARRATIVE, NOT COMPROMISE THE LEGITAMACY OF IT"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">Moreover, the film explains most of the magical elements in the narrative. When Riggan is flying over the streets to the theatre, we realise he in fact, simply took a cab. There is thus no juxtaposition of both realities. The end point is the same (reaching the theatre), the reality of taking a cab suggests that Riggan and the film has not completely departed from reality, while the magical aspect of flying suggests Riggan’s desire to be extraordinary, to be elevated figuratively. He is able to go on an introspective journey and understand himself better as he is able to actually look at and hence realise the existence of his wants and fears. He is able to look at how his desires take form in the world and how he interacts with the physical world, literally getting his thoughts out of his head.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">This leads to a metamorphosis of Riggan as a character. Riggan, upon realising how extreme he is in his pursuit for stardom, reflects upon his personality, his actions, him as a failing father, and his divorce. It is after this reflection, does Riggan appreciate his ex-wife and his daughter Sam, having more intimate and honest conversations with both of them. He even tells them her loves them, which he has never said before in the film. This gesture which represents the honesty and genuine affection he had for his family signifies a transition into a better person. Instead of focusing only on himself, he seeks companionship and familial relationships.  This thus proves that the magic reality adds on to the narrative, not compromise the legitimacy of it. In fact, the latter was the impression most audiences had of the film. They believed the film to be confusing, or unnecessarily complicated, but to the contrary, it is only with the utilisation of magic realism, is Iñárritu able to tell a more accurate story of Riggan and his play. Without magic realism, the film would only portray Riggan as insane and irrational. On the other hand, the reflection of Riggan’s own psyche that is presented as the magical reality allows the film to be able to delve into Riggan’s subconscious, his thoughts and inner conflicts – a world so intimate no human being is able to peer into in the physical reality. What is being perceived is a fusion of both realities - a <mark>hyper-reality</mark>.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>THE CONTROVERSIAL ENDING</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">The movie ends with Riggan jumping out of the window to his hospital ward. Sam runs to the open window, only to smile as she gazes up into the sun. Many have wondered whether Sam is actually smiling at the father who is flying, or was it all just part of the magical reality. In fact, it was the latter. In the credits, in the background of the jazz music played over the credits, were sirens. This insinuates that Riggan had not actually flew to the sky, but instead was in need of medical help. This perfectly aligns with what I mentioned earlier. Riggan imagines his daughter smiling at him as he has made his Broadway play an astounding success, even to the extent that he has created a new style of acting – hyper-realism. Since Riggan presumably did not survive the long fall, the magical reality did not need to persist after the credits as Riggan has died and there was no mind to continue perpetuating the desires of a living person. <mark>Hence, at the very end of the film, the very moment Sam’s smile towards the sky cuts to black, is when Riggan breathes his very last breath.</mark></p>
