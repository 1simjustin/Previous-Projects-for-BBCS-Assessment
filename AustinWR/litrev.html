<h3>FILM THEORY</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">Film theory is an academic study which aims to imagine and picture the essence of cinema while at the same time consisting of frameworks and “schools”? (Robert Stam, 2000) which help comprehend a film’s relationship with reality.</p>

<h3>RUSSIAN FILM THEORY</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">Named the formalist approach, Russian Film Theory is a type of method used to analyse film and its meanings. This method regards the film strictly by its “structure and form” (P.Jacobs, n.d), where formal narrative elements would be examined, including but not restricted to character, setting and repetition, as well as specific techniques such as camera movements and sound in relation to the image. In other words, this theory sought “a highly scientific basis” (Robert Stam, 2000) for something so subjective as the aesthetics. By considering its synthesis of the multiple elements, one is able to “perceive scenes and interpret the meaning behind them” (P.Jacobs, n.d). Hence, one is able to fully comprehend the significance of each cinematic element in the film, and therefore catapult the extent of one’s understanding of the film in its entirety. Thereafter, one may reference various fields to better understand the film’s significance, examples including psychology, logic and linguistics. Thus, it is an apt method for a better understanding of the film and its characters, especially with the emphasis on Magic Realism.</p>

<h3>FILM TECHNIQUES</h3>
</div>
<p class="sideright"><b>"THE AUDIENCE DOES NOT FEEL THE EXISTENTIAL WEIGHT BUT THE WHIMSICAL SURREALISM OF MAGIC REALISM"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">There are some film techniques worth noting, which would allow for a more comprehensible and relevant discussion in the next chapter. Depending on the context, these film techniques may take on different roles and hence different effects, sometimes that of the unconventional.
The Long Take is an example and it is extensive used in Birdman. The Long Take prevents ambiguity as there are no gaps between shots. Another effect would be to allow the audience to “be the film director with their eyes” (Steven Spielberg, n.d), which would ironically leave a dash of subjectivity. It may even create suspense, if the camera stays stubbornly away from the action that could be implied, for example sound. This is particularly significant considering the entire Birdman movie comprises a single long take.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">Sound is another important element. Sound can be divided into two categories, diegetic sound and non-diegetic sound. Diegetic sound is sound that has a source in the story world while non-diegetic sound is sound edited into the story, e.g. a movie’s soundtrack. However, a film’s narration may deliberately blur boundaries between these two categories, thus able to “puzzle” or “surprise” the audience, creating “ambiguity” in interpretation  (McGraw Hill, p.367). In fact that was exactly what Birdman does throughout.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">Mis-en-scene refers to the deliberate positioning of everything within the shot. It could be easily understood as an umbrella term for most cinematic elements, including lighting, lens flares, and characters’ positioning just to name a few. Therefore, its effects are heavily dependent on the context of the film. It should be noted that this is more of a critic’s term rather than a director’s.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF MAGIC</h3>
</div>
<p class="sideleft"><b>"SIMILIAR TO THE POSTMORDENITST
APPROACH - TO RENDER EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES INTO STRANGE, UNFAMILIAR ONES"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">Magic Realism as a term is presented as an “oxymoron”, a combination of words that present ostensibly conflicting ideas. In other words, it is fusion of both realism and fantasy. However, how exactly this is done in film or perhaps in any literary work remains equivocal. As scholar Jean-Pierre Duex describes, “commentators have used that term ‘magic realism’ to refer to so many different works of art that the term has largely lost its value for making distinctions between genres”. However, he comments that the “basis” of the magic realist or realism is of “mimetic illusion while destroying it regularly with a strange treatment of time, space characters or what many people take as the basic rules of the physical world.”(Durix, 1998) In other words, it is quite similar to the postmodernist approach – to render everyday experiences into strange, unfamiliar ones. In the context of a film, there requires to be a uniform type and manner of alteration to each experience in order to create a coherent complete piece of work. This may be best understood as the film’s own idiosyncratic “internal logic” (Brandstatter, 2014). These said alterations are not random and devoid of meaning; they are intentional and have a desired effect or meaning to encapsulate. </p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">Taking the limited amount of research around, Frederic Jameson's essay On Magic Realism in Film, published in 1986, may be the best source to understand its nature in cinema. According to Jameson, magic realism in cinema has two salient features:</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody"><i>“the very different color of each [film] constitutes a unique supplement and the source of a peculiar pleasure, or fascination, or jouissance, in its own right; in each, finally, the dynamic of narrative has somehow been reduced, concentrated, and simplified, by the attention to violence (and, to a lesser degree, sexuality).”</i></p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">This is very much relevant to Birdman as the film experiments with various colors, as well as the ostensibly saturation of violence in the film, be it a floodlight falling onto an actor’s head, or Riggan throwing a tantrum in his room and destroying a poster of Birdman. Adding on to this definition, scholar Maggie Ann Bowers states that the  magic realist element is done with the aim of “initiating questions concerning philosophical issues”. (Bowers, 2004). Thus, it is worth noting that by using magic realism to bring philosophical questions to the front, we may better answer Riggan’s philosophy and therefore state of mind.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">In Kim Anderson Sasser’s essay Magical Realism and Cosmopolitanism, Magic Realism can take on one or the combinations of three modus operandi: subversion – “to subvert realism and its representative worldview”; suspension – “magic and realism are suspended between each other disjunctively”; and summation – “magic functions summationally towards reality/realism”.</p>

<p class="litimg" style="padding-bottom:2%;">SUBVERSION SUSPENSION SUMMATION</p>
<br>
</div>
<br>
<p class="introbody">The first may be understood as a form of “deconstructive narratology”, where themes, subjects and notions of reality is undermined by the magical and the laws that it follows. This means that there is a hierarchal relationship between the two. The second locks magic and reality in a dynamic equilibrium. Since the laws of both worlds are incompatible, neither can fully come into being and therefore are suspended, creating “gaps, absences and silences”. Finally, the third is of the very opposite, that these said laws may exist together to form a intricate “synthesis” between magic and reality. It ironically, is a movement to “move closer than realist authors in presenting reality”.  This is because such use of magic realism pushes the boundaries of visual representation for objects which in realistic works simply represent themselves. However, summation does not leave the narrative immune to tweaks done to aspects of physical reality – time, space, etc. Summation can too “fix the mundane and the magical on the same plane”, thus giving it a constructive function. To be able to identify the forms that may or may not exist in the film would make it possible to understand the film’s position among these three modi operandi. This would thus provide us an accurate mapping of Riggan’s state of mind as the relationship between magic and reality may become more comprehensive guided by the characteristics of these various forms.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">Conventions of various iconic film techniques used in the film have to be researched, as after all, they serve as the most fundamental gears to this machine that is this film. Mapping out the relationships between these gears and their functions in the film through the Russian Formalist Theory would enable this research to better grasp the overall meaning of the film. This has to be done in the context of magic realism and therefore it is essential to understand the conventions of how and why magic realism is created in order to best comprehend Iñárritu’s ideal. By being able to recognise which modus operandi of magic realism the effects of the film techniques used in Birdman may subsume under would provide a clearer lens through which we grasp the overarching meaning of the film.</p>
