<h3>BIRDMAN</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody"><i>Birdman</i>, or (<i>The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance</i>), is the brainchild of Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu. It scored a 91 out of a possible 100 on rottentomatoes.com. and received rave reviews leading to 9 Oscar nominations, and eventually winning the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody"><i>Birdman</i> follows a washed up schizophrenic actor Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton) in the last six days before debuting on Broadway with his theatre adaptation of Raymond Carver’s short story “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love”. Once a fantastically successful superhero in the role of Birdman, Riggan struggles through his creative gamble to revive his career and his self worth by writing, directing, and starring in the adapted play. But as the alternative title `The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance’ suggests, it is to be a vain venture of delusion and desperation. He does all he can to maintain psychological stability while worrying about the success of his opening on Broadway and constantly disturbed by his past failures as a father and a husband.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE</h3>
</div>
<div class="sideright">
<p><b>"THE AUDIENCE DOES NOT FEEL THE EXISTENTIAL WEIGHT BUT THE WHIMSICAL SURREALISM OF MAGIC REALISM"</b></p>
</div>
<p class="introbody"><i>Birdman's</i> successful cinematographic and narrative complexity are mainly attributed to the “self-conscious” dilemmas that Thomson faces in the days before the premiere of his Broadway staging of Carver’s story. Thomson regards respect to be synonymous with love, leading him to an insatiable hunger for fame and praise. His obsessive attempt to prove himself as an artist is to be his undoing in the same way his play is to be unravelled.  The instability of Thomson’s psychological state is effectively elucidated through the blurring of what’s real and what’s imagined in the movie which on another level effectively parallels what’s reality and what’s fame. This meta-movie makes extensive use of a complicated set of camera angles to create the stylised surrealism of Riggan’s hallucinations and  yet for the audience, one is never sure if his superpower to levitate objects, is part of his imagination, and so a sign of his insanity,  or an extension of the movie’s intention to point to an odd, circular world where art and reality blur to the point of being indistinguishable. The extensive use of the close-ups with the camera trained on the extended dialogues between characters makes the movie feel like a series of progressively intensifying sketches of characters’ relationship with each other, culminating in their unravelling when reality sets in. However, the audience does not feel the existential weight but the whimsical surrealism of magic realism.</p>
<br>
<div class="sideleft">
<p><b>"TO POINT TO AN ODD CIRCULAR WORLD WHERE ART AND REALITY BLUR TO THE POINT OF BEING INDISTINGUISABLE"</b></p>
</div>
<p class="introbody">The unique cinematic technique pathologises fantasy. The excesses of desiring not just success but a life that looks and feels like a work of art is conveyed through some of the following means:  The camera does not seem to cut to the next scene throughout the film; a man in a bird costume whispering into Thomson’s mind who vanishes and as quickly he reappears; a jazz drum beat that leaves audience questioning whether it was diegetic or non-diegetic material; a bizarre ending of Thomson’s daughter beaming as she gazes the sky in awe after Thomson jumps off the window of his hospital ward. In fact, it was this conclusion, with all its ambiguity, that has confused and at the same time dazzled audiences ever since its release, sparking numerous online discussions on various platforms, about the many possible interpretations.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">Audiences are left wondering just what <i>Birdman</i> is about. Is it a superhero narrative? Is a critique of the theatre/entertainment industry? Is about the media’s pervasive influence? Or all of these and more? All these effects on the audience are a result of the extensive use of magic realism where the subjectivity of the film is experienced differentially, real or otherwise, by different audiences.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">Magic Realism is not a new technique, and has been employed by filmmakers since the 1980s. However, <i>Birdman</i> is undoubtedly, the most successful film ever made which relies on Magic Realism to tell a tragic but phenomenal story (9 Oscar nominations).</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody1">How does the director Alejandro González Iñárritu employ Magic Realism in the film?</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody1">What are the multifaceted intention and the subsequent effects of his use of Magic Realism on audiences?</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody1">How effective have film techniques been synthesized to create an accurate working of an unstable schizophrenic mind at the same evoking an ambiguous outcome that is open to multiple interpretations?</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>THESIS STATEMENT</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody1">Magic Realism is utilised in Birdman not just as a tool but as a very necessary element of the story. Without it, an accurate depiction of a distorted perception of reality is unable to be realised, nor would the director’s intent on the film’s nature be evident.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>SCOPE OF RESEARCH</h3>
</div>
<p class="sideright" style="margin-top:-0.7%;"><b>"WHEN THOMAS SPROUTS HIS WINGS AND SOARS ABOVE THE SKYLINE, THE  RUBICON BETWEEN SANITY AND REALITY IS CROSSED FOR GOOD"</b></p>
<p class="introbody">This research paper will reference the film Birdman, but more than that, it will explore the concept of Magic Realism and how it has been successfully utilised in the film. Film theories will underpin this paper’s analysis of the various cinematic elements employed to achieve the meta effect on the audience, and how they merge what is real with what is delusional, leaving the audience confused but at the same time dazzled. As one critic has said, “When Thomas sprouts wings and soars godlike above the skyline, the Rubicon between sanity and reality is crossed for good.”</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>LIMITATIONS & DELIMITATIONS</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody">Since the movie’s analysis will be centred on Magic Realism, some technical and philosophical aspects of the film would be outside the boundaries of this paper’s analysis. Moreover, since Birdman is a relatively recent film, few scholastic articles have been written about it and so my analysis could be somewhat speculative.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">This research paper will rely extensive on online movie reviews.</p>
<br>
<p class="introbody">However, there is no lack of scholastic articles on the theories of Magic Realism and so this paper will reference it extensively and will attempt to make analyses and conclusions based on my understanding of that theory/concept.</p>
<div class="heading" style="margin-top:3%;">
<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
</div>
<p class="introbody" style="margin-bottom:2%;">This paper will employ a qualitative method of research in order to substantiate the thesis statement. Close reference will be made to film techniques, specifically Russian Formalist Film Theory, and the Theories of Magic Realism, in order to understand the director’s ambiguous intent and its effects on audiences.</p>
